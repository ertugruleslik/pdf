**I need your help!**
This project is becoming more popular by the day. I'm drowning in a flood of new issues and bug tickets. So I probably need your help to solve the issue. While we're at it: would you like to hunt down the bug yourself and to send me a pull request?

**Check this first**
The project is a wrapper around Mozilla's PDF viewer, so maybe your bug is caused by the base library. Please check this first by answering these three questions:
- Does the bug also happen on https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/web/viewer.html? (If so, please open the issue at Mozilla's bugtracker).
- Does the bug also happen on https://pdfviewer.net/simple?
- Can you write a reproducer based on a freshly created project? To create such a project, please use `ng new myissue` and `ng add ngx-extended-pdf-viewer`.


**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is. For example:
1. Go to '...'
2. Click on '....'
3. Scroll down to '....'
4. See error

**Version info**
- Version of ngx-extended-pdf-viewer

**Demo PDF file**
Many errors happen with specific PDF files only. So please add a PDF file (after checking the copyright of the PDF file first!)
