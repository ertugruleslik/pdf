# Add the remote, call it "upstream":

# already done
# git remote add upstream https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js.git

# Fetch all the branches of that remote into remote-tracking branches,
# such as upstream/master:

git fetch upstream

# Make sure that you're on your master branch:

git checkout bleeding-edge

# Rewrite your master branch so that any commits of yours that
# aren't already in upstream/master are replayed on top of that
# other branch:

git merge upstream/master
# git merge upstream/v2.11.338
