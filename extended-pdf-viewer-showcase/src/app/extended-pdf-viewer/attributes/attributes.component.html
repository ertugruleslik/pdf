      <h1>Accessing the base library directly</h1>
      <p>
        The PDF viewer is based on a Mozilla project, pdf.js, which offers many options and features I didn't expose as
        an API of ngx-extended-pdf-viewer. Nonetheless, it's there, so you can use it as long as you know what you're
        doing. The API I'm describing below isn't likely to change any time soon, but that's difficult to predict,
        so be careful. If you run into such a change, please open an issue at <a
          href="https://github.com/stephanrauh/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/issues">GitHub</a> so I can update
        the documentation. Note that I won't try to keep my fork of the base library compatible. That's simply
        impossible with such an active project.
