# Trying a well-tested configuration

This PDF viewer requires some configuration. That, in turn, has driven many good developers nuts.
So my recommendation is to check if `<ngx-extended-pdf-viewer>` works on your machine. That's a good basis to continue. If something does not work, it's probably something to do with different configurations.

So please clone this repository first:

```batch
git clone https://github.com/stephanrauh/extended-pdf-viewer-showcase.git
npm install
ng serve --open
```
